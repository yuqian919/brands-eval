Adidas,"Adidas is engaging in work to assess its wage practices across Asia, but as a company it is still not willing to define what a living wage means in its business. By failing to do this, and passing on responsibility for wages in supplier factories to factory owners, the significant change needed for workers will never happen. Adidas must engage in identifying a living-wage figure and changing pricing in order to enable its payment.",4

Aldi,"Very little evidence was given by Aldi North or Aldi South of any work to address the problem of low pay.

Tex,"Global brands such as Carrefour cannot wash their hands of the responsibility to work out how to pay a living wage, while acknowledging the fact that a wage should meet basic needs.

Kik,"
This company did not respond to our request for information and makes little data 
available on its website about labour rights or living wages. Charitable work to patch up holes caused by the extreme poverty that exists in the fashion industry is not the kind of response
that is needed from global buyers. Help for education and healthcare projects in Bangladesh is all
very well, but only in addition to serious engagement in improving low wages for workers. The need to
pay a living wage is the primary responsibility of global buyers, and information on how Kik is
progressing towards this goal is the sort of thing we would hope to read on the responsibility page
of its website in the future. The fact that there is no information available about work to increase
wages currently leads us to assume the worst: that none is being undertaken.
